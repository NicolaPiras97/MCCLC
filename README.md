# Multilevel cross-classified latent class models for categorical data 

This is the code we used for the simulation 1 in the paper "Multilevel Latent Class models for cross-classified categorical data: Model definition and estimation through stochastic EM". The code in this version is available for simulation reproducibility purposes only and is an incomplete version of the code necessary to perform full analyses applying the Multilevel Latent Class models for cross-classified categorical data.

## Usage
To run the simulation launch the .R file Simulation_setting_1, wich recalls a C++ program. Be sure to have installed .R, and the R packages Rcpp, RcppEigen and
RcppArmadillo.
