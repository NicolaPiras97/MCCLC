# Multilevel cross-classified latent class models for categorical data 

This is the code we used for the simulations in the paper "Multilevel Latent Class models for cross-classified categorical data: Model definition and estimation through stochastic EM". The code in this version is available for simulation reproducibility purposes only and is an incomplete version of the code necessary to perform full analyses applying the Multilevel Latent Class models for cross-classified categorical data.

## Usage
To run the simulation launch the .R file, which recalls a C++ program. Be sure to have installed .R, and the R packages Rcpp, RcppEigen and
RcppArmadillo.
